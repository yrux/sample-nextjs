# Demo Node.js Site: Continuous Deployment to Acquia Cloud
 This repository contains a simple Node.js web application. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate a complete continuous deployment (CD) workflow to Acquia Cloud.

## Purpose
Showcase how a Node.js application can be set up for automated deployments to Acquia Cloud.
Provide a reference for integrating CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) with Acquia Cloud’s deployment APIs.
Serve as a starting point for teams looking to implement or improve their deployment automation.

## Features
Minimal Node.js web server (for demonstration)
Example configuration for continuous deployment
Scripts and instructions for deploying to Acquia Cloud
Ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow (or insert your CI/CD tool of choice)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
    Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
    An Acquia Cloud account with deployment API access
    (Optional) jq for script JSON parsing if using deployment scripts
### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/demo-nodejs-acquia-cd.git
cd demo-nodejs-acquia-cd
npm install
```

Running Locally
```
npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Continuous Deployment Workflow
This repository includes:
CI/CD workflow configuration (see .github/workflows/ or your chosen CI provider)
Deployment scripts to trigger code deployments to Acquia Cloud via API
On every push to main (or your configured branch):
The CI pipeline runs tests and builds the app.
If successful, a deployment is triggered to the specified Acquia Cloud environment.
See deployment.md (if present) or the workflow YAML for detailed steps and configuration.

### Customization
Update environment variables and secrets in your CI/CD platform for Acquia Cloud credentials.
Modify the deployment script as needed for your team’s workflow or environment structure.
